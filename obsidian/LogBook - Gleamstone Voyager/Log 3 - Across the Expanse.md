### Overview
The party ventured across the landbridge connecting the continents together but came up against a blockage on the tracks.
They met [[Yelvin]] and [[Freddie Nickel]] who were in dispute over who was responsible for the big magic ball that had destroyed some tracks.
After some to-ing and fro-ing the party were attacked by sea creatures and finally a hag, which once defeated made the magical ball disappear so everyone could go on their way.
[[Freddie Nickel]] hired the party as protection until they got to [[Kredlam City]]

### Locations
- The Expanse (middle of the sea)
### Breakdown
- The party found a big magic ball which had destroyed one of the tracks on the landbridge, on one side there was [[Freddie Nickel]], on the other was [[Yelvin]] and also a Priest of the Locomotive Order to try and sort things out.
- It became quickly apparent that [[Yelvin]] and [[Freddie Nickel]] suspect each other of foul play, [[Yelvin]] suspected [[Freddie Nickel]] would try and steal something from [[Yelvin]]'s giant drill train whilst [[Freddie Nickel]] suspected [[Yelvin]] of blocking access to [[Kredlam City]].
- The party tried to mediate but they were attacked by some sea creatures and a sea hag, after which the ball disappeared.
- Everyone went their own way except [[Freddie Nickel]] hired the party as protection until [[Kredlam City]] as some of his armed guard died in the attack.
