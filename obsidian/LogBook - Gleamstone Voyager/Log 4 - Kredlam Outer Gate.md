### Overview
The party arrive at [[Kredlam Outer Gate]] where they discover some strange power issues whilst waiting to be vetted. They agree to help out and end up losing [[Taelin]] to a bunch of elementals. [[Freddie Nickel]] went his own way after this.

### Locations
- [[Kredlam Outer Gate]]
- [[Kredlam Power Plant 12]]

### Breakdown
- The party arrived at the [[Kredlam Outer Gate]] with [[Freddie Nickel]] and begin the vetting process with [[Pinthy Chester]]. The process takes a while so they hang out at the local Inn where they discover some strange power outages.
- They also meet [[Isaac Laxleaf]], a local scientist researching Elementals, who shows the party how to communicate with them using a strange device which [[Davros Broadbloke]] later tried to replicate.
- Eventually they head out and help fix the Power Plant issues and discover sabotage! And lots of elementals they have to fight through. After a terrible combat, everyone except [[Taelin]] managed to get out before the building collapsed and exploded.

### Items gained
- Stones containing elementals
- Badly working elemental communication pipe
