### Overview
The party started their adventure and made their way to [[Bilbun]], whilst there they met [[Darren Biggs]], [[Axel Tarrofax]] and [[Nina Arborfist]]. They fought some Rocktopi and made the mine safe again.

### Locations
- [[Arden City]]
- [[Bilbun]]
### Breakdown
- [[Gleamstone Voyagers]] was formed with [[Taelin]], [[Lady Lilliana Aveline]] and [[Davros Broadbloke]]. [[Geraldine Lorrinus]] was there too!
- [[Davros Broadbloke]] acquired their first away mission; to locate and retrieve some blueprints from [[Grenzo]]'s Gleamstone Co.
- [[Davros Broadbloke]] also acquired a "favour" from [[Finneas Valentine]] to check up on an engineer by the name of [[Axel Tarrofax]] in [[Bilbun]] as it had been a while since his last report.
- The party encountered [[Rosco]], a member of some shady group who offered a great boon for bringing the blueprints back to his employer, [[Mr Sinclair]] instead. The party refused this offer.
- On the way to [[Bilbun]] there was a runaway train whilst threatened to collide with them, but they managed to avoid this narrowly by changing track at the last second. They briefly investigated the wreck of the crashed train but found no survivors or anything of note.
- Upon arriving at [[Bilbun]] the party noticed something strange with the [[Ward Rod]] in the centre of town.
- The party visited the Inn and asked around for the Engineer to discover that [[Axel Tarrofax]] was generally disliked by the townsfolk due to his extravagant lifestyle and unwillingness to fix the ward rod.
- They also discovered that the [[Ambrite]] mine had ceased operations due to some workplace injuries involving Rocktopi.
- The party ventured into the mines and beat up some Rocktopi, [[Davros Broadbloke]] died but then didn't.
- [[Davros Broadbloke]] met the love of his life, [[Darren Biggs]] and [[Davros Broadbloke]] immediately proposed.
