### Overview

Kredlam is the shining jewel of [[Desteria]] and has stood the test of time and the effects of the [[Breach]]. In the sake of safety since, most Kredlamites are suspicious of outsiders.
The major points of tension in the city right now are the opposing worship of [[Lyndak]], the god of misfortune and mainstay deity for generations, and [[God King Vashma]] who rules over the city with an iron fist.
Also going on is the migration from [[Ambrite]] power to [[Gleamstone]] power, however there seems to be a lot of Elemental influence also making it's way through the city.
