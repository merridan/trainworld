###### Dream 2
The wind outside your room starts to pick up, the rush of the wind and the rustle of the tree branches outside serves as white noise to usher in your sleep.
As your eyes flutter and your mind lies heavy with the toll of the day, you begin to spiral into a deep sleep.
The wind stays with you, softly whooshing until it grows and grows until it surrounds you.
Suddenly you're outside, the wind is all around you, the heat draining you, the sand stinging your eyes and skin as you trudge through the vast open desert. You push on only by the will of survival. One foot in front of the other is all you can muster so thats what you focus on. You can't be caught, not now, not after you've been through.
You've travelled far enough and heard enough from local gossips to know that the other temples have also fallen, their Void Relics stolen by the Gilded Conclave. You know that there is every chance you are the last Acolyte of the White Void.

The night is closes so you begin setting up camp, before collapsing into an exhausted slumber plagued by memories of that fateful night. The spray of blood and death of your sister still haunt you.
The screams of your Dana mutate as you wake up by the sound of neighing horses. Rushing out of your tent you see 2 heavily armed men dressed in gold, and behind them are several mounted archers.
One of the men shouts "Ellarita, last of the White Void, Arterion has ordered your capture, make this easy " he gestured to a rope " or difficult" he says gesturing to his blade. 

Your anger builds

They start moving slowly towards you, adopting the traditional Conclave fighting stance. Your body moves faster you can think as you charge the closest of the two.
With your sisters dagger in hand you get inside the first mans guard and strike three times in rapid succession, splattering the sand with blood he falls to the ground before he could react.

Your anger builds

The second launches a flurry of slashes at you, only just hitting you with glancing blows as you block and dodge most hits, the clash comes to an end as you find the right moment to get low and spring up, pushing the dagger up through his jaw into his head.

You turn to face the rest, bleeding and breathing heavy. 
Your anger builds 

The mounted archers rush to surround you and together pull their bows and with one barked order FIRE! their arrows speed towards you.

As your anger reaches a boiling point your vision glazes over and your consciousness is taken over by a white hot rage.

You open your eyes and what you see is a perfectly clean circle around you surrounded by a field of blood and gore. Severed limbed, sliced up torsos, and  other mangled body parts lay strewn about, soaking into the hot sand.

You limp up towards the crest of the dune and look out at the expanse of the desert, as the sandclouds clear you see in the distance the Crowned City - Kredlam.
